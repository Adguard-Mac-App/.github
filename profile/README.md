## What is AdGuard?  

**AdGuard for Mac** is a professional **ad-blocking and privacy protection solution** tailored for macOS. It eliminates intrusive ads, pop-ups, banners, video ads, and even trackers that slow down your system and invade your privacy. Developed by **AdGuard Software Ltd.**, it provides a native macOS experience, working system-wide — not just in your browser.  

Unlike browser extensions, **AdGuard Mac** filters ads at the network level. This means it blocks unwanted content across **Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge**, and any app that connects to the internet. Whether you’re streaming videos, browsing social media, or reading news, AdGuard ensures a clean and distraction-free environment.  

The app also includes **tracking protection**, **phishing defense**, and **parental control** features, giving users total command over their online safety. Its built-in **DNS filtering** system helps block malicious domains, encrypt DNS queries, and even speed up network performance.  

AdGuard supports **macOS Ventura, Monterey, and Sonoma**, and runs flawlessly on **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)** devices.  

In short, **AdGuard for macOS** is more than an ad blocker — it’s an essential security layer that enhances privacy, improves speed, and gives you full control of your online experience.
